2. Establish the World
3. Create the Characters
4. Start the Game
5. Ask a Question
6. Role the Dice
7. Deal with the Consequences 
8. Win the Game

### Negotiate the Limits

Before you play __FUCK__ you need to establish what is acceptable and what isn't between everyone playing (including the dm).

#### Do's and Don'ts

To do this you can use this simple negotiation framework:

Everyone writes down what they want (the DO's) in bullet form on a sheet that has their character name on it. In FUCK this can be kinks, situations, themes, topics or anything else, try and keep it succinct, no more then a short sentence.

Everyone should have at least 2, less then 6 of each:

- adventure genres / settings
- kinks/fetishes

Pass your DO sheet to the person next to you, that person then place a make next to any of the items:

| Mark                  | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| X (cross/ letter x)   | a hard limit (non-negotiable boundary)                   |
| ! (exclamation point) | soft limit (needs more negotiation/specific situations). |
| âœ” (check mark)        | interest, want to have this in the game for sure.        |

Once everyone has their page back, you go around and each person reads out their the items that have X while on person records them on a new page, then the items with âœ” are recorded in the same manor.

Items with a ! are then read off one at a time and a discussion is had when/how they would be acceptable. If no clear consensus is made (not everyone agrees) these are added to the X group if everyone agrees, the item is elaborated on with the the established details and added to the âœ” group.

Review the two pages, your Do's and Don'ts and have everyone approve. Items can be added or removed from these as you play if needed.

#### Safewords

Another thing you need to establish before you begin is a way for anyone that needs to, communicate the following:

- They want or need to stop.
- Need to pause and talk something through.
- Indicate that they would like to be more involved.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> 
> No one should feel bad about using these safewords, everyone's safety and sanity come first and foremost. Establishing a buddy system or some physical representations of the safewords can help if people have problems with verbal communication or confrontation.

Its recommended you use an establish framework for this for simplicity and clear communication, one such framework is the BDSM traffic light ðŸš¦ system:

| Safeword  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”´"Red"    | Stop everything immediately and engage the person to see if they need anything to help through what they are going through. If there are specific requirements that a person has for medical or other needs, this should be recorded on their character sheet or somewhere that those around them have access to. |
| ðŸŸ¡"Yellow" | Pause and talk through whats going on, maybe take it a step back or alter whats going on to help that person feel more comfortable/happy.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ðŸŸ¢"Green"  | That person would like to have more or be more involved. This doesn't necessarily mean that things need to be paused but you can take a moment to double check or hash things out.                                                                                                                                |

If you change these, make sure you write them down and that they are accessible to anyone that needs to review. 

### Establish the World ðŸŒŽ

__FUCK__ is built to be collaborative in its play, this includes world creation.

After you've negotiated your [Do's and Don'ts](#dos-and-donts) and [Safewords](#safewords) you now can build out the world from them.

This process should:

- be collaborative and leave everyone excited to play
- have room to make things sexy

It should NOT:

- be overly detailed/broad
- talk about specific characters / events

The questions you want to answer in this step is:

- What kind of adventure is this going to be?
  - An Mud Wrestling Championship Gone Wrong
- What makes this world special?
  - The next president gets picked by who wins the Championship.
- What are the limits of the world?
  - Is there magic? What level of technology is available?
- What is the main goal of the adventure?
  - Help get the Championship back on track.

> [!CAUTION] 
> 
> __FUCK__ is meant to be about safe, sane, consensual fun. Due to how violence/bloody conflict can introduce triggering and potentially moral and ethic issues, it's highly recommended to implement a no violence rule into your worlds.

Here are some potential ways you can get started:

- Take the Themes and Settings from the __Do's__ list and put then on slips of paper and mix them up in a bowl or hat. Select two and combine them to make your adventure theme.
- Use the Themes or Settings that had the most âœ” in the Do's list or a combination of the top voted.
- Select/Modify a existing Adventure Campaign to work with everyone's [Do's and Don'ts](#dos-and-donts)

#### Pre-made Adventure Campaigns

Even though __FUCK__ is created to make adventure creation easy, its always easier to start from somewhere and work from there.

We will be [adding various campaigns here](/campaign/) as we make them, if you feel like submitting one of your own, feel free to [follow this process](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-pre-made-adventure-campaigns) or publish it somewhere on your own!

#### The Dudgeon Masters (DM's) Responsibility

Once the questions have been answered and everyone has agreed to the world the DM can then begin creating Scene and Non-Player Characters (NPCs) Sheets to populate them.

These sheets should be pieces of paper that have the following information on them:

- The Name of Scene
  - Example:
    - Finding Evidence in Town Hall
- The Setting:
  - What it looks like?
  - Who is present?
  - What time is it?
- A few Descriptors, at least one, no more then 5. 2-3 is recommended.
  - Examples:
    - Crowded
    - Hot
    - Dark
    - Loud
- What can go wrong?
  - The bad outcome if the scene is failed.
  - Examples:
    - The characters get blue balls.
    - The evidence gets destroyed.

The DM can populate these with NPCs by creating sheets that have:

- The NPC name (single or group as they are treated the same)
- Descriptors: see Descriptors for more details.
- Gear: see Gear for more details.
- Conditions: see Conditions for more details.
- Notes: Any additional information pertinent to the story.

### Create the Characters ðŸ‘¥

Characters in __FUCK__ should sexy and fun, don't try and be to serious or "optimized".

To make a Character you need to come up with:

- Name
- Concept
- Description
- Descriptors
- Drive
- Gear

Optionally you may want to include:

- Relationships
- Conditions
- Additional Notes/Details

Some [Pre-made Adventure Campaigns](#pre-made-adventure-campaigns) may also include ready characters for you to play.

#### Name

In __FUCK__ character naming is all up to you! Have fun and don't take it too seriously, make it something memorable so people can easily remember it.

Name tags that people can wear or stand up in front of them can be helpful. 

Examples:

- Kinky Pinky
- Whiplash Willow
- Bondage Betty
- Dommy Daisy
- Tie Me Up Tessie
- Submissive Samantha
- Leather Lacey
- Flogger Frankie
- Chain Gang Charlie

#### Concept

A concept in __FUCK__ is a simple phrase or few word descriptor the answers the question:

Who is your character?

Examples:

- Domineering Dominatrix
- Smooth Submissive
- Smiling Sadist
- Muscle Mommy

> [!NOTE]
>
> Cliches and archetypes are okay!

#### Description

Your characters description is a paragraph where you expand on your concept, give background and details about:

- How they look?
- Where are they from?
- What makes them interesting and uniquely sexy?

Keep this short and sweet, no need to write an essay.

Example:

Dommy Daisy is a active pro domme with lots of experience. When shes not kicking balls or whipping butts she enjoys shopping for leather or latex outfits.

#### Descriptors

These as the most important or interesting features about your character.

Make them short, punch, clear, innate and finite.

Add one for each of the major characteristic groups:

- Body
- Mind
- Edge
- Flaw

#### Drive

What does your character strive for? What do they want, and why can't they get it? What will they do to grasp it?

This is a good place to put a twist into things, spice things up.

#### Gear

What kinky, fun, or interesting things does your character carry?

Figure out two items of Gear and given them a name using a adjective and noun.

Example:
- Strong Vibrator
- Wicked Whip
- Shiny Bodysuit


#### Relationships

Does your character know another? How are they connected?

> [!WARNING]
>
> These relationship __MUST__ be consensual and negotiated between players.
> No means no and stop asking.

#### Conditions

Throughout the game your character may be affected by some condition that last for a specific amount of time or until some action is taken.

#### Notes

These can be important bits of information that don't fit elsewhere.


#### Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

The DM will need to create character that the player will interact with, most of the time this just means a slightly less detailed characters that can have some special Notes.

NPCs groups are treated as one entity.

For example:

Name: Beefy Guards
Descriptors: Large, Muscly, Not to Bright
Gear: Leather Harness, Tight shorts
Conditions: [x] Bored, [ ] Distracted, [ ] Out of Action
*Notes: There are the same number of Guards as players.

# Freeform Universal Consensually Kinky (FUCK) RPG

A 18AD, for adults only, table top RPG style system based on sex and kinks. Meant to make adventuring with leather, whips and chains; safe, sane and consensual.

Heavily inspired by [Lilith's Throne by Innoxia.](https://lilithsthrone.blogspot.com/) and based in, but in no way endorsed by the [FU: Freeform Universal RPG system.](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal/)

Adventurers find themselves transported into a realm governed by __[Lilith]__, who declared all violence outlawed and sex free the way to resolve differences by her divine might.

The adventurers must use their wits and whiles to face their inner and often outer demons, discover new and exciting powers and loot, and conquer or be conquered by their quest.

## Quickie Summary

Gather a group of kink friends, a handful of six sided dice (D6) in two colors and a [character sheet](./CHARACTER_SHEET.md) for each player. Negotiate what type of content is allowed in the game, then make your characters.

Optionally you can get some tokens for the Drama points, colored cards for manual safewords, and a [Adventuring Contract](./ADVENTURING_CONTRACT.md)

### Characters

Characters are constructed by making several simple choices.

#### Attributes

Write four evocative statements about your character, defining their most interesting features.

#### Drive

Write an interesting instinct, attitude, belief or relationship that your character has.

#### Gear

Record any equipment your character has. Give your character a memento - a small object of personal significance.

> __The first rule__
> Use common sense, consent and the “rule of cool” to guide all that you do. Nothing else matters.

### Getting Going

When you attempt an action where the outcome is uncertain, and both success and failure are interesting, make a check.

__Do the following:__
1. Phrase your action as a question, like “Can I fuck that guy?” or “Do I leap the tentacle pit?” Make it clear and specific.
1. Create a die pool from the two colored dice, one color will be the Action Dice (AD) and the other your Danger Dice (DD). Begin with one AD. 
   - Add more AD for each helpful tag or advantage you have. Better position, taking your time, and attributes are common bonuses.
   - Add a DD 8 for every disadvantage affecting your action. Being rushed, a poor position and a threat’s tags often add Danger dice.
1. Roll the dice. Each DD cancels out a matching AD. The highest remaining AD is your result.
     - Botch: if all the AD are cancelled, the result counts as a roll of “1”.
1. Consult the Oracle to determine how well you did. Describe the consequences.

That’s it. Whatever you attempt, from swinging on a chandelier to fucking a magic stool is resolved in this way.

### The Oracle

| Roll | Result     |                                            |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 6    | Yes and... | You succeed and gain some other advantage. |
| 5    | Yes...     | You succeed.                               |
| 4    | Yes but... | You succeed, but at a cost.                |
| 3    | No but...  | You fail, just.                            |
| 2    | No...      | You fail.                                  |
| 1    | No and...  | You fail and things get much worse.        |

### Consequences

Always use the fiction to guide the resolution of checks. Common consequences include:

- __Conditions__: add or remove a condition from someone / thing.
- __Danger__: put someone in a dangerous situation or make the things worse.
- __Gear__: use up, break, lose, repair or replace a piece of equipment.

# Glossary ðŸ“œ

Here is a collection of important recurring terms used in these rules:

## Dungeon Master (DM)

The Dungeon Master is the arbiter and narrator of the adventurers story.

## Campaign

Refers to a long-term series of interconnected adventures or scenarios within a role-playing game. It typically involves a consistent group of players and a central storyline that unfolds over multiple sessions. 

Campaigns can span weeks, months, or even years, allowing characters to grow, develop, and face various challenges.

A campaign that spans one day is usually referred to as a "one-shot" adventure or just one-shot.

In the case of __FUCK__, you can create a campaign by linking together multiple one-shot adventures or by developing an overarching plot that ties individual sessions together.

## Session

A single playthrough of __FUCK__. It usually takes place during a specific time frame (e.g., an evening, a weekend afternoon).

Players gather to continue the ongoing story, explore new situations, and interact with their characters and the game world.

In __FUCK__, a session could be a standalone adventure or part of a larger campaign. It's where players collaborate, make decisions, and roll dice to resolve actions.

## Scene

Represents a distinct moment or encounter within a session. It could be a conversation with an NPC, a battle, a puzzle-solving segment, or any other significant event.

Scenes contribute to the overall narrative and allow players to engage with the game world.

In __FUCK__, scenes can vary in scaleâ€”from epic battles to personal interactionsâ€”and the system adapts to the questions posed by the players during these scenes.

## Turn

A __turn__ refers to a specific player's action or decision within a scene. During a turn, a player might describe what their character does, attempt a skill check, or engage in combat.

In __FUCK__, turns are more fluid. Every roll corresponds to a YES/NO question, and the dice provide answers like "Yes, and," "Yes," "Yes, but," "No, but," "No," or "No, and." The scale of questions can change based on dramatic necessity, allowing for dynamic storytelling. For example, a player might ask, "Can I hit the guy with my sword?" or "Do we win this war?".

## Player Character

A character controlled by a player.

## Non-Player Character

Any character in the game that is not controlled by the players.
